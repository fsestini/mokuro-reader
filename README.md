# mokuro-reader

This project aims to offer [mokuro](https://github.com/kha-white/mokuro)'s functionality as a single-page webapp.
Instead of reading OCR'd manga from the static HTML pages generated by `mokuro`,
with this webapp one imports a ZIP file containing just the images and `mokuro`'s OCR data as JSON files;
an equivalent of `mokuro`'s static page is then generated dynamically for the imported files.

Key points of this approach compared to plain `mokuro` HTML files are:

* Manga files are bundled in a ZIP and thus easily transferable to, for example, mobile devices.
* The ZIP files can be stored anywhere on the device's filesystem; it's not required to copy them
  in specific subdirectories to make them openable by browsers. One only needs to make this webapp
  accessible to the reading device once and for all, either by copying its files locally or by serving it through
  an [HTTP server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server).
* It comes bundled with the popup dictionary tool [yomichan](https://github.com/FooSoft/yomichan),
  which is included in the project as a standalone JavaScript library rather than a browser extension.
* The project is a PWA (progressive web app) and is recognized as such by iOS, which allows to view it fullscreen
  if properly installed.
  
For these reasons, this project should come in handly to users of [particularly restrictive mobile platforms](https://www.apple.com/ios)
that

* do not allow to open local HTML files, such as the static pages generated by `mokuro`
* do not allow to install browser extensions such as Yomichan
* have limited support to viewing HTML pages in fullscreen
